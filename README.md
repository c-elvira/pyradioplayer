# pyradioplayer
Radio player for Raspberry Pi written in Python3

## ToDo

### Will (must) be done
- setup.py
- threading socket connection (only one connection at a time for now)
- improve safety
- allow to pause radio to listen to Youtube, then automatically restart radio (see proof of concept)
- change radio

### Perspectives
- spotify, soundcloud support
- visual outputs : 
    -> song title on a screen?
    -> automatically adjust volume to reach a custom audio level (in decibel)? audio level sensor?
